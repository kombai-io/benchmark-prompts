Design a messaging interface for a team collaboration application. Implement a detailed chat area for viewing message threads, including user profile images, chat bubbles, and file attachment previews. Add a message input field at the bottom with an emoji picker and a send button. Include chat header options for initiating calls, archiving conversations, and viewing participant profiles. Implement a primary sidebar displaying a list of recent conversations, each with user avatars and timestamps. Integrate a search bar above the conversation list to facilitate quick navigation.

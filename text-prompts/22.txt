Implement a feature that displays a list of suggested connections. Create cards that contain a circular image at the top, followed by a name and an affiliation underneath. Include a section showing mutual connections using small circular images. Add a button labeled "Connect" at the bottom of each card. Place a link labeled "See all" in the top corner to allow viewing more suggestions.

Create a web application interface for uploading video files. Implement a central upload area featuring a button to select files, with clear indications of supported formats and file size limits. Include buttons for discarding the upload or posting the video. Add dropdown menus for selecting visibility settings and video categories. Provide input fields for entering video captions and labels, each with defined character limits. Incorporate checkboxes for configuring user interaction permissions, along with a toggle switch to enable or disable copyright checks. Include a dedicated section for uploading video thumbnails, with visual placeholders to guide users.

Create a billing history interface that displays invoice details. Include columns for Invoice Number, Billing Date, Status, Amount, and Plan. Implement sorting functionality for each column. Add checkboxes to allow invoice selection. Provide options to export and download selected invoices. Display pagination controls at the bottom. Ensure the interface updates dynamically based on user interaction.

Design a hotel room booking application interface. Display available rooms prominently with images, room details, and pricing per night. Clearly indicate room availability status and the total number of available rooms. Include a search bar for filtering by room type and a sorting feature to help users find their ideal room. Implement a section for detailed room information and amenities to support user decision-making. Add interactive elements such as buttons for editing room selections and booking confirmations. Ensure the interface includes user profile access and navigation options for seamless user experience. Display contact information and booking policies at the bottom of the interface for easy reference.

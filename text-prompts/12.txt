Design a social media application interface with a central feed that prominently displays user posts and interactive elements. Add a post creation section at the top of the feed, featuring intuitive input fields and submission controls. Integrate individual post blocks that include user details, images, and buttons for likes, comments, and shares. Incorporate a top menu with selectable options for different content views or categories. Include a voting poll feature within the feed to encourage user engagement. Design a right-hand panel to display user profile information, including activity statistics and contact details.

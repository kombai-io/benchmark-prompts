Implement a frequently asked questions section for a website. Place a header that includes a question mark symbol on each side. Add a title and subtitle directly beneath the header. Create collapsible boxes for each question, featuring plus and minus icons to expand and collapse answers. Arrange multiple questions in a vertical list. Each box should reveal a text answer when clicked

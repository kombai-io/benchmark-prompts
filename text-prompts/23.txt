Create a task management board with multiple columns representing different stages of progress. Implement functionality to add, edit, and move tasks across columns. Include visual indicators for task deadlines and assigned team members. Add buttons in each column for creating new tasks. Ensure each column displays the total task count and provides options to sort tasks by priority or deadline.

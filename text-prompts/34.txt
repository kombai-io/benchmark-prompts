Implement a chat interface for customer service communication. Use a two-column layout with a conversation list on the left and the active chat on the right. Add a search bar at the top of the conversation list. Include timestamps and message indicators beside each conversation. Display messages in the active chat using a speech bubble format with alternating colors for user and service responses. Place an input field at the bottom of the active chat for sending new messages.

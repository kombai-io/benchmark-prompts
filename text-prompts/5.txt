Design a user interface for a billing management application. Start with a section that displays current plan details, including metrics such as data usage and the number of team members. Implement a billing history table with columns for invoice, billing date, status, amount, and plan. Provide options for users to export and download their billing data. Incorporate a dedicated section for managing payment methods, showing card details with an option to edit. Include pagination controls at the bottom of the billing history table for easy navigation

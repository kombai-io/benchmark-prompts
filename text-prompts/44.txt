Design an e-commerce website for a skincare line. Implement a hero section with a prominent call-to-action button. Highlight featured products with images and descriptions. Incorporate a navigation bar with links to product types and informational pages. Add a section with customer testimonials, including star ratings and product links. Integrate an FAQ section with collapsible questions and answers. Place a subscription call-to-action near the bottom of the page. Ensure a footer is present with contact information, additional links, and social media icons.

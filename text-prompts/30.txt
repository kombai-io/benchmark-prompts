Implement a user profile feature that displays essential user information and related content. Place a profile picture and user ID at the top. Include sections for a brief user description, media with a "Show All" option, documents with file size and a "Show All" option, and links with associated URLs. Ensure each section is clearly labeled and structured for easy navigation. Add interactive elements to edit profile details and access additional content.

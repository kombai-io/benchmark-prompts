Create a web application interface for managing a code repository. Add a main code display area with syntax highlighting and line numbers for improved readability. Ensure the inclusion of a search bar to enable quick access to files. Implement a top navigation bar with clickable tabs for switching between different file types. Include a file tree panel for navigating through project directories and files. Integrate a status bar at the bottom to display notifications and error messages. Use a collapsible side panel to house additional tools and settings for advanced interactions.

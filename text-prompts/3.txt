Design a user management interface within the team settings module. Implement a section for managing admin users, including capabilities to add and remove users. Include a separate section for account users, allowing evaluation of associated risks and data issues. Each user entry should display the name, email, date added, and last active date, along with options to edit or remove the user. Provide a button to add new team members. Ensure checkboxes are present next to each user entry to support selection actions. Use breadcrumb navigation at the top to indicate the current location within the settings hierarchy.

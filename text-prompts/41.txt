Create a design for a restaurant website that effectively showcases its culinary offerings. Design a hero section featuring a highlighted dish with call-to-action buttons for reservations and viewing the menu. Implement a booking section with input fields for name, date, and number of guests. Display popular menu items in a grid layout with names and prices. Incorporate a narrative section about the restaurant with a "Read More" button. Add a map with markers to indicate restaurant locations. Ensure the footer contains navigation links and social media icons for easy access.
